### Paladin
Armed with the powers of light, and with the power of their Faye Bucklers (Bucklers of light created with the merging of flesh and magic into an aparatuss that allows the user to insert Sun Stones), the Holy Order of Paladins protect the realm from all threats, but especially those of the demonic kind, versed in both the acts of exorcism and righteous combat. These holy warriors use steel and soul to protect those who require aid, and will not falter.

### Black Knights 
While the past of the Black Knights remain a mystery, their presence in the world is not. They are a mercenary group of men and women who have become corrupted in part by Dark Magic, allowing them untapped physical and mental strength led by a man said to be immortal. The Black Knights, however, are in fact keepers of the peace, who use their power in the fight against evil, inflicting damage through both arms and magic. Yet their path to acceptance will be a long one, for who will trust those that so easily use dark magic.

### Engineer 
Deep within the northern lands lies the city state of the Engineers, an exclusive guild that dedicates their lives to the art of construction and technological marvels, both for the safety of their allies, and the death of their enemies. Known easily throughout the realm by their special Steam Converterâ€™s (Backpacks with hypercharged steam) they create marvels of such technological mastery that it almost seems made of magic.

### Elementalists 
When magic was discovered in the world, the few men and women not immediately wary of it became entranced with it, and most of all filled with a new sense of discovery. The works to study magic has eventually led the the creation of the Academy of Magic, a place where those who have the gift to harness magic learn to become one of many Elementalists, who not only use their powers of natural magic to shape the elements suited for humanity, but also to the destruction of those who must be purged.

### Druid 
When the first well of White Magic was discovered, the tribe watched in astonishment as creatures of mythical beauty and majesty emerged from the well of magic. Believing it to be a sacred place, the people of this tribe vowed to not only live with this force, but to also protect both this and any other wells of white magic. After centuries of guarding, the Druids now have become one of the most respected figures in the world in the knowledge of white magic, and have been changed by it as well, summoning the forces of nature both externally and within, allowing them to morph into creatures better suited to protect their home.

### Demonologist 
The practice of black magic long thought dead, the Demonologists of the world have finally surfaced the help with their expertise in both the Black Arts and their abilities to control the demonic forces that will ravage the land. Though their intentions may be questionable, and their magic appaling, the may be exactly the kind of help needed to save the world from permemnat darkness.

### Assassin 
When those with magic became too powerful, in times when the realm needed men and woman who can slink in the dark and kill with swift efficentcy, the Assassins Brotherhood have been there to quell magic users believed to be dangerous to the realm. While their hate for magic has been evident, the Assassins role in the world has still given them a dark reputation, which prevents them from truly fitting in with the normal populace. Yet they will continue their crusade, and they will not falter.

### Battlemaster 
Deep in the northern parts of the world, the Battlemasters have forged themselves into one of the deadliest non-magical warriors in the Realm, mastering exotic weapons and having the ability to use them to almost impossible feats. As such these warriors continue to protect the northern slopes of Krog, the capital of the Northern tribes.
