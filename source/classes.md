### Paladin
In the realm of Stonehaven, boys and girls with no homes and no hopes for the future are taken in by the Paladin order and trained to become holy knights. These Paladins are to become the most respected order of warriors in the kingdom. With the power of their Faye Bucklers and control of holy magic, the Holy Order of Paladins protect the realm from all threats, but especially from those who wish to use dark magic. Versed in both the acts of exorcism and righteous combat, these holy warriors use steel and soul to vanquish evil, and will not falter in their duties to both the kingdom they serve, and the citizens they strive to protect.

### Black Knights 
While the origins of the Black Knights remain a mystery, their presence in the world is not. They are a mercenary group of men and women who have become corrupted in part by dark magic, allowing them untapped physical and mental strength. Rumor also has it that they are led by a man who is said to be immortal. The Black Knights, however, are in fact keepers of the peace, who use their power in the fight against evil, inflicting damage through both arms and magic. Yet their path to acceptance will be a long one, for who will trust those that so easily control dark magic.

### Engineer 
Deep within the northern mountains lies the city state of the Engineers, an exclusive guild that dedicates their lives to the art of construction and technological marvels. These men and woman toil endlessly in their craft, both for the safety of those they wish to protect, and for the creations that will help the lives of those who need it. When those of ill intent try to take these creations by force, however, they quickly learn that the Engineers do not need the aid of others to protect their work. Known easily throughout the realm by their special Steam Converterâ€™s, the Engineers create marvels of such technological artistry that some question if these marvels could actually be made without magic.

### Shaman
When the first reservoirs of elemental magic were discovered in the world, the few men and women not immediately wary and fearful of its alien qualities became entranced with it, and most of all filled with a new sense of discovery. Within the hearts of these people, the elements of the world broke forth and manifested into control of the wild forces of nature, opening their eyes to the vast array of life and responsibility contained within the very ground they stood upon. These men and women used these powers to become Shaman's, spiritual leaders who helped warm the bodies of the cold, sate the thirst of all living things, spread the seeds of life through the winds, and create homes from the earth. Yet for those who wish to destroy the harmony of the elemental world, know that their fury will be fully unleashed through the vessels of their Shaman protectors. 

### Druid 
When the first well of pure magic was discovered, the tribe watched in astonishment as creatures of mythical beauty and majesty emerged from the well of magic. Believing it to be a sacred place, the people of this tribe vowed to not only live with this force, but to also protect both this and any other wells of white magic, and so named their home Crovasta, the Crater of Life. After centuries of guarding, the Druids have become one of the most respected figures in the world, with unparalleled knowledge of pure magic. Their exposure to this purest form of magic has changed the people of the Crovasta, allowing them to summon the forces of change and growth both externally, and within. 

### Demonologist 
The practice of black magic was thought to be dead long ago. Yet in these dark times the Demonologists of the world have finally surfaced in to public eye. They wish to help against the coming darkness with their expertise in both the Black Arts and their abilities to control the demonic forces that will ravage the land. Though their intentions may be questionable, and their magic appalling, the may be exactly the kind of help needed to save the world from permanent darkness.

### Psychomancer
The mysteries of the mind and of the unnatural world has always grabbed the attention of those who wish to study the art of magic.The works of these men and women to harness and study the arcane realms of this world eventually led the the creation of the Acaderium, a place where those who have the gift to harness the arcane and the unknown learn to become one of many Psychomancers, who use the powers of arcane magic to expand their ever evolving understanding of the natural world. Yet when one talks of the horrors of war, none skip past the exploits of those Psychomancers who shaped the battlefield with the destruction of the minds and bodies of soldiers who stood in their path.

### Assassin 
When those with magic became too powerful, the Assassins Brotherhood rose up to become one of the largest threats against the magically inclined, suddenly appearing from the shadows to quell magic users believed to be dangerous to the realm. While their hate for magic has been evident, the Assassins role in the world has still given them a dark reputation, which prevents them from truly fitting in with the normal populace. Yet they will continue their crusade, and they will not turn a blind eye towards those who wish to abuse magic.

### Battlemaster 
Deep in the northern parts of the world, the Battlemasters have forged themselves into one of the deadliest non-magical warriors in the Realm, mastering exotic weapons and having the ability to use them to almost impossible feats. Yet these warriors see themselves as true artist's, and spend their lives perfecting the path's of combat, each unique and beautiful as they are deadly. As such these warriors continue to protect the northern slopes of Krog, the capital of the Northern tribes.
